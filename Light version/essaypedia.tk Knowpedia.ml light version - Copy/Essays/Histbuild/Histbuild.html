    <p> "A thing of beauty is a joy for ever."-<strong>Keats</strong> <br> <br> Historical places have special attraction for mankind, for they teach us while they amuse us. They present before us a past glory and an artistic sense. <br> <br> In our country there are several cities, famous for historical buildings. Agra is at the top. It is famous for the Taj Mahal. I with three of my friends decided to see Taj at Agra. Next morning we reached the station. The train to Agra was to leave at 8 a.m. <br> <br> There was a great rush at the platform. In two hours we reached Raja-Ki-Mandi station, from where we hired a tonga and reached the Taj. <br> We purchased the tickets and entered through the main gate. There we saw two grand lawns. In between them there was a long passage. We crossed the passage and saw the main building. It was built by Shah Jahan in the memory of his beloved queen, whose name was Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj is named after her name. <br> <br> The Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful buildings of the world. On account of its beauty and grandeour it is called one of the 'seven wonders of the world.' There are several fountains, many green lawns with cypress trees and all kinds of bright flowers. On the gate of the main building the verses from holy Koran are engraved. <br> <br> Inside the tomb there are four graves- two in the upper storey and two in lower one. The graves in the lower storey are real. Though during the day the Taj looks very attractive, yet at night in the light of the full moon it seems to be a palace of silver. <br> After spending five hours there, we returned by bus. All of us were immensely pleased to see it and wished to see it again. <br> <br> -:Thank You:- </p>
