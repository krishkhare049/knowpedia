    <p> International Yoga Day is celebrated annually on 21 June. It was started in 2015. The idea of an International Yoga Day was first proposed by Narendra Modi. He suggested that day of 21st June to UN because it is the longest day of the year. By the efforts of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, UNGA declared 21st June as the International Yoga Day, on 11th December 2014. <br> <br> Yoga is an invaluable gift of India's ancient tradition. In Sanskrit, the term 'Yoga' stands for union. The basic idea of Yoga is to unite atma or the individual soul with paramatma or the universal soul. It embodies unity of mind and body, thought and action, harmony between man and nature. It is not only exercise but also a path to concentration. <br> <br> Yoga has been gaining immensly popularity now-a-days due to the short-term as well as long-term benefits. People find solutions of many health problems. They can achieve an all round development of a calm, stress free mind and fit a body. <br> <br>-:Thank You:- </p>
