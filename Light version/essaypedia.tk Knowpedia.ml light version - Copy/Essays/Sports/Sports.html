    <p> "The battle of Waterloo was won on the playground of Eton." - <strong>Wellington</strong>  <br> 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy' goes the saying. Develepment of the body is as important as that of the mind. Games and sports keep the body fit. They are food for the body, as knowledge is the food for the mind, and religion for the soul. If health is wealth, games and sports are the means to get it. <br> <br> Games and sports are very essential for health. They refresh the mind and fill the body with vigour. They keep us free from diseases. They provide fresh oxygen and make us more active. Their importance is untellable. <br> <br> Games and sports develop a sense of discipline among the students. A disciplined team wins the game. The players abide by the rules of the games and the judgement of the refree. This teaches the players the importance of obeying rules and regulations in life. Therefore, sportsmen are generally found more disciplined persons than others. So, we could play outdoor games and sports to keep us fit. <br> <br>-:Thank You:-</p>
