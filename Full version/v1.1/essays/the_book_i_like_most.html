    <p>"My never-falling friends they are <br> With whom I converse day by day." - <strong>Southey</strong> <br> <br> "A books is a precious life blood of its master." - <strong>Milton</strong> <br> <br> I am very fond of reading books. I have read a good number of novel, one-act plays, short stories and poems. But the books that I like most is the 'Ramcharit Manas' of Goswami Tulsidas. 'The Ramcharit Manas' is a famous book of the Hindus. It tells us the life history of Ram Chandra (reincarnation of Lord Vishnu) who was the son of King Dashrath of Ayodhya. When he was only a boy, he went with sage Vishwamitra and killed many demons there. He broke the bow of Lord Shiva and was married to Sita (reincarnation of Goddess Lakhsmi). According to a boon, granted by King Dashrath o his queen Kaikeyi, Ram went to the forest to live there for 14 years. With him went Sita and Lakshman.  In the forest, his wife Sita was kidnapped by Ravana, the king of Lanka. Ram with the help of monkeys invaded Lanka, killed Ravana and brought back Sita. Ram returned to Ayodhya after 14 years and was crowned as king. <br> <br> There are many reasons for liking this book. The Ramcharit Manas is the picture of an ideal society. Ram is an ideal son, an ideal brother, an ideal husband and an ideal king. In his charater we have a perfect man. <br> <br> -:Thank You:-  </p>
