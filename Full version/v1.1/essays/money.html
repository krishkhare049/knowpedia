        <p>Time is undoubtedly money. In the past when the needs of the people were limited, barter system was in
            practice. People used to give what they had and they took what they needed. There was no money system or
            currency. They just had exchange of goods. As their needs increased and civilization advanced, barter system
            could not serve the purpose. Then came monetary system. The basic purpose and use of money was to buy and
            sell goods in markets. <br> <br> Money ! more money ! and more money ! In present times it would not be
            exaggeration to say that there is nothing without money. Money is everything for men today. Our wants are
            unlimited. The things we need in our day to day life are procured from different places. To buy not only
            goods but also services of many people i.e. doctors, teachers, engineers, electricians, barbers, tailors,
            rickshaw pullers, conveyance and what not we need money. <br> <br> In our daily life, money is everything
            but we should not done the missuse of money. <br> <br> -:Thank You:- </p>
