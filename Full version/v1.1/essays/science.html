    <p>"It is excellent <br> To have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous <br> To use it like a giant." - <strong>Shakespeare</strong> <br> <br> "Science has given powers fit for gods but we use them like small children." - <strong>C.E.M. Joad</strong> <br> <br> Science is neither blessing nor curse. It is what man makes it. Science can be the greatest of the blessings or worst of the curses. We blame science. In fact, we should blame man. Science as a servant serves us in many ways. It is a blessing if we use it as a servant. It is a curse if we make it our master. "Science has given us powers fit for gods, but we use them like small children. The great defect of science is that we don't know what to do with our knowledge." <br> <br> Science has helped us in conquering time and distance. Trains, motor cars, steamers, steamships and aeroplane take us quickly and comfortably from one place to another within a short span of time. Man can fly in the air like a bird and swim in the ocean or under water like a fish. When science becomes our master, it is very destructive. Aeroplanes and ships can be misused for carrying war materials for destruction. The aeroplanes can be used for dropping bombs on innocent people.They can demolish beautiful buildings, cities, museums, dams and kill men, women and children in no time. Railway trains can be misused for carrying armies, arms and weapons to enslave other people and countries. <br> <br> Thus we see that science has brought both Heaven and Hell to the world of man. It is up to man to use them judiciously for constructive purposes. <br> <br> -:Thank You:-  </p>
