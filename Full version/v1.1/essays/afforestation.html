        <p>Forests shield the soil from the sun's rays. Without trees, even the richest soil may soon become
            unproductive. Once the mountain slopes were covered with magnificient forests. They were cut down to provide
            land for mankind. From trees we get coal, building materials, valuable good drugs, gums, dyes and items of
            food. But all above, trees purify the air and enrich the soil. They protect us from extreme heat and cold.
            Trees help conserve soil and water. They also provide oxygen and recreation for vacationists. <br> <br>
            Oxygen is the prime need of our life. We inhale oxygen when we breathe and exhale carbon-di-oxide. Trees
            take it and convert it to oxygen again. Thus the cycle continues. Trees also cause rain. They prevent the
            soil grom being washed away. They provide shelter to wild animals like lions, tigers, bears, rhinos etc.
            <br> <br> Afforestation must be one of our main aims. It is the duty of the government and the people to
            preserve the forest wealth. Our government has started the festival of Van Mahostsav or the Forest Festival.
            There is also a Forest Research Institute at Dehradun. <br> <br>-:Thank You:-
