        <p>The 15th of August, 1947 is a red-letter day in the history of India. On this day India got freedom from the
            English after a long struggle under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. Besides great leaders common people
            also took part in freedom struggle. Thus 15th of August is a historic day for the Indians. It has become our
            national festival. It has special meaning for all people of the country. It reminds us of the sacrifice and
            suffering that the freedom fighters had to face for winning freedom. <br> <br> The 15th August is celebrated
            with great joy and pride every year as the Independence Day. The national flag is hoisted on all the
            government and private buildings of the country. Due respect is shown to the flag by way of military and
            mass salute. There is joy and happiness throughout the day. Public meetings are held and the importance of
            the day is explained. At the Red Fort, special arrangements are made for its celebration. Here the Prime
            Minister of India unflurs the National Flag. <br> <br> 15th August, 1947 is a memorable day for the Indians.
            It brings us the message that we should forget our internal difference. We should keep in mind the interest
            of the country above all. In the words of late P.M. Lal Bahadur Shastri, it brings for us the message that
            "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." <br> <br>-:Thank You:-</p>
