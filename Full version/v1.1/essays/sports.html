        <p> "The battle of Waterloo was won on the playground of Eton." - <strong>Wellington</strong> <br> 'All work and
            no
            play makes Jack a dull boy' goes the saying. Develepment of the body is as important as that of the mind.
            Games
            and sports keep the body fit. They are food for the body, as knowledge is the food for the mind, and
            religion
            for the soul. If health is wealth, games and sports are the means to get it. <br> <br> Games and sports are
            very
            essential for health. They refresh the mind and fill the body with vigour. They keep us free from diseases.
            They
            provide fresh oxygen and make us more active. Their importance is untellable. <br> <br> Games and sports
            develop
            a sense of discipline among the students. A disciplined team wins the game. The players abide by the rules
            of
            the games and the judgement of the refree. This teaches the players the importance of obeying rules and
            regulations in life. Therefore, sportsmen are generally found more disciplined persons than others. So, we
            could
            play outdoor games and sports to keep us fit. <br> <br>-:Thank You:-</p>
