    <p>A zoo is place where different kinds of living animals, beasts and birds are kept. It is a place of great interest for all, particularly for the students. By paying a visit to zoo, people living in cities can have knowledge of different species of animals, birds and reptiles in the world. <br> <br>The zoo in the Lucknow is located near Hazrat Ganj. Last year I happened to see it with my father. The entry to zoo was by tickets. We bought tickets and entered the zoo by the main gate. We started from the right hand side. There were deer, stags and blue cows. These animals came to us in the hope of getting something to eat. Then we saw two rhinos standing in cool and muddy water. We then moved to the next section of the zoo. There were wild animals like lions, panthers, tigers and leopards and bears. They were in separate cages. Then we saw monkeys and chimpanzees. Then we saw kangaroos, zebras and a giraffe. A white elephant was also there. I enjoyed the elephant ride there. Then we saw wolves, hyenas and jackals in their separate cages. We saw water birds like duck, swan,cranes etc. Then birds like parrots from different countries, white peacocks and other beautiful birds of different kinds attracted a large gathering. We saw crocodiles, snakes and cobras. In fact, zoo is a place of education, general knowledge and entertainment. <br> <br>-:Thank You:- </p>
