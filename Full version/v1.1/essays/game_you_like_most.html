        <p>Games play an important role in our life. In fact, games are very essential for health and we all know that
            health is wealth. Sound body and sound mind go hand in hand. Games help us both physically and mentally.
            Cricket is one of important outdoor games. It is an English game but it is very popular in India. It is more
            interesting than football and hockey. It is the game of two teams with eleven players on each side. It is
            played with long bat and hard ball. <br> <br> The game of cricket is very interesting. I like this game very
            much. Once I got a chance to witness a cricket match on our college ground. Last year in the month of
            November our college played a cricket match against the team of D.S. Inter College, Aligarh on our college
            ground.<br> <br> The weather was very fine.Flags were fixed on the boundary. The spectators were sitting all
            round on benches and chairs. At one end there was a score board on which a man was writing the runs made by
            players. When the match was started we were very nervous. Our team won the toss and chose batting first.
            After two hours our whole team was out by making two hundred sixty runs. Then the Aligarh team bat and made
            two hundred runs. In this way our college won the match by 60 runs. The important thing in life is not
            conquering but playing well. <br> <br> -:Thank You:- </p>
