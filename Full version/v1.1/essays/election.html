        <p>Elections are life and soul of a democratic system of a government. In India we have democracy. Democracy is
            the government of the people, for the people, by the people. In a democracy, people form the kind of
            government they want to rule over them. Elections provide them opportunity to do so. In India elections are
            held after every five years. <br> <br> When elections are held in country the scene is very exciting.
            Meetings are held, processions are taken out and representatives of different parties with placards go from
            door to door folding their hands asking the to vote for their candidates. The parties are canvassing in
            favour of their candidates. Flags of the parties can be seen at all important centres. A day before the
            polling day all the canvassing is stopped. When the voters go to the polling booths, there is a privacy in
            the booth. The voter had to press the button againt the name of the candidate he want to vote for. A beep
            sound from the machine is the signal that the vote has been successfuly cast. Then the poling officers seal
            EVMs and other relevant records. The police van comes and collects the EVMs to take them to collectorate for
            counting. <br> <br> -:Thank You:-</p>
