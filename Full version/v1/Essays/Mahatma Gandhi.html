    </header>
    <p>"Gandhi was a unique combination of greatness and grace. Such a man is born but once in a millennium." - <strong>C.E.M. Joad </strong> <br> <br> Mohandas Karam Chand Gandhi (known as Mahatma Gandhi) was the greatest man of his age. He was not only a great politician but also a great social and religious leader. Gandhiji believed in the fundamentals of ancient culture. He declared that the highest form of service of the great mother was social service. He gave message of peace to the whole world and believed in humanity. He was deeply influenced  by the west and 19th century European Liberalism. He loved his countrymen very much. So the nation called him 'Bapu',the father of the nation. <br>
    Mahatma Gandhi was born at Porbandar in Kathiawar on October 2,1869. His father Kaba Gandhi was the Diwan of Rajkot. His mother Putli Bai was a very noble and religious lady.
    He was sent to school at the age of seven. He was shy and did not mix with other boys of his age. But he was very honest and hardworking. He had no liking for games and gymnastics. He was married to Kasturba at the age of thirteen. He passed the Entrance Examination at the age of seventeen. Then he went to England for higher education. <br><br> On his return from England he began to practise as barrister in Bombay High Court, but he was not successful in the profession. He started Satyagrah movement for the rights of Indians. He did not take rest till the Indian Relief Act was passed. In 1913, he left for South Africa in order to plead the case of a firm named Dada Abdulla & Co. Gandhiji returned to India in 1915 and joined the Indian National Congress. He started the Non-cooperation Movement in 1920 and Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930. Gandhiji's main principles were truth and non-violence. <br> <br> On January 30,1948 he was shot by Nathu Ram Vinayak Godse in a prayer assembly at Birla House Delhi. Gandhiji lived and died for love, truth and non-violence. He was one of those great personalities who gave light to the world. So long as India lives and Indian freedom lives, the name of Mahatma Gandhi will be remembered. <br> <br> <strong>-:Thank You:-</strong>
