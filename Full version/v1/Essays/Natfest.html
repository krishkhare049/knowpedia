        <h1>A National Festival</h1>
    </header>
    <p> The 15th of August, 1947 is a red-letter day in the history of India. On this day India got freedom from the English after a long struggle under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. Besides great leaders common people also took part in freedom struggle. Thus 15th of August is a historic day for the Indians. It has become our national festival. It has special meaning for all people of the country. It reminds us of the sacrifice and suffering that the freedom fighters had to face for winning freedom. <br> <br> The 15th August is celebrated with great joy and pride every year as the Independence Day. The national flag is hoisted on all the government and private buildings of the country. Due respect is shown to the flag by way  of military and mass salute. There is joy and happiness throughout the day. Public meetings are held and the importance of the day is explained. At the Red Fort, special arrangements are made for its celebration. Here the Prime Minister of India unflurs the National Flag. <br> <br> 15th August, 1947 is a memorable day for the Indians. It brings us the message that we should forget our internal difference. We should keep in mind the interest of the country above all. In the words of late P.M. Lal Bahadur Shastri, it brings for us the message that "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." <br> <br>-:Thank You:-</p>
